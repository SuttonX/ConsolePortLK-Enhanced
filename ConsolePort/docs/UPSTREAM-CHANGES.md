## Release package versus Git checkout

All controller artwork in this candidate is retained byte-for-byte from the official release package. Twelve Steam Deck icon files in that release package differ from the upstream Git tag checkout. These inherited packaging differences are not new artwork created by Enhanced. Text line endings also differ between archive and checkout; compare normalized text when reviewing behavior.

## Contribution path

Fork leoaviana/ConsolePortLK into SuttonX/ConsolePortLK-Enhanced to preserve ancestry. Upload these sources to the fork, then open a pull request targeting the original repository’s master branch if you want to offer the changes upstream. The original maintainer decides whether to incorporate them.
